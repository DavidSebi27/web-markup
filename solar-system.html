                <li><strong>Key Features:</strong> The Sun is the central star of our solar system and provides the necessary light and heat to sustain life on Earth. It is composed mainly of hydrogen and helium and is approximately 4.6 billion years old.</li>
                <li><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Every second, the Sun converts about 4.1 million tons of hydrogen into helium through nuclear fusion!</li>
