        <h2>Wonders of the Cosmos</h2>
        <p>
            Space, the vast and mysterious expanse that stretches beyond our Earth, has long captivated the human imagination. From the earliest civilizations, we’ve looked up at the stars, wondering what lies beyond the sky and how it all works. Space exploration, which began in earnest in the mid-20th century, has transformed those ancient questions into a pursuit of knowledge, fueled by technology and curiosity. The launch of Sputnik in 1957 marked the first step, quickly followed by the monumental achievement of landing humans on the Moon in 1969 during NASA's Apollo missions. Since then, we've sent robotic probes to every planet in the solar system, revealed the turbulent surface of Venus, the massive storms of Jupiter, and the icy, unexplored regions of distant dwarf planets like Pluto.
            <br><br>Human space travel has evolved too, with the International Space Station (ISS) serving as a symbol of global cooperation, orbiting 400 kilometers above Earth. Astronauts live and work there for months at a time, conducting scientific experiments that could improve life on Earth or prepare us for longer journeys into space. Missions like the Mars rovers and the groundbreaking James Webb Space Telescope continue to deliver incredible insights, revealing details about the ancient universe, star formation, and the potential for life on distant worlds.

        <h2>The Pillars of Creation</h2>
        <article class="pillar-article">
        <p class="pillars-text">
            The Pillars of Creation are one of the most iconic features of the Eagle Nebula, located about 6,500 light-years from Earth. These towering structures are composed of gas and dust, providing a stunning view of stellar formation. The pillars are not only visually captivating but also serve as a nursery for new stars, showcasing the complex processes that shape our universe. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope have revealed intricate details about these massive columns, highlighting the beauty and mystery of cosmic phenomena.
        <ul>
            <p>Key Facts about the Pillars of Creation:</p>
            <li>Location: Eagle Nebula (M16), approximately 6,500 light-years away from Earth.</li>
            <li>Composition: Made up of cold hydrogen gas and dust, providing a dense environment for star formation.</li>
            <li>Height: Each pillar is estimated to be about 4 to 5 light-years tall.</li>
            <li>Formation: The pillars are created by the intense radiation and stellar winds from nearby young stars that erode the surrounding gas and dust.</li>
            <li>Discovery: The structures were first photographed by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1995, bringing them to public attention.</li>
            <li>Evolution: The pillars are not static; they are constantly changing as stars form and evolve within them.</li>
            <li>Significance: They illustrate the process of star formation and provide valuable insights into the life cycle of stars in the universe.</li>
        </ul>
